# docraider

A way to categorise your documents and then search them.

# Motivation

Aims to work with nothing but the filesystem, for several reasons:

 - You can throw away this app and still use your data
 - You can encrypt everything by using an encrypted filesystem
 - You can backup with rsync

## Prerequisites

You just need Java 7

## Running

```java
  java -jar docraider.jar /path/to/my/doc/store
```
